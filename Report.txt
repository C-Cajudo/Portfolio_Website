at the start i had problems with the divisions, 
that some of the pages were slightly lower

fixed that issue by removing a <br> making the sites
on the same height.

managed to create a background, but may need to make it 
not just a plain colour.

deciding on what buttons to have for navigation, either
links or buttons,

made links to social media, and they go to an blank page, 
and brings up a new tab on the browser, {say what code
was used to create it and w3schools}

managed to make buttons, struggled at making 
them the right size, and figuring out which parts of the code i need
{show code}

i need to know how to let the buttons go smaller when the 
browser gets re-sized

finally added links to the buttons, and now they work

added a pdf onto the CV tab and will add a download button with a pop up
so the page looks fancy,
