at the start i had problems with the divisions, 
that some of the pages were slightly lower

fixed that issue by removing a <br> making the sites
on the same height.

managed to create a background, but may need to make it 
not just a plain colour.

deciding on what buttons to have for navigation, either
links or buttons,

made links to social media, and they go to an blank page, 
and brings up a new tab on the browser, {say what code
was used to create it and w3schools}

managed to make buttons, struggled at making 
them the right size, and figuring out which parts of the code i need
{show code}

i need to know how to let the buttons go smaller when the 
browser gets re-sized

finally added links to the buttons, and now they work

added a pdf onto the CV tab and will add a download button with a pop up
so the page looks fancy, 

trying to add download button, havent figured out yet, so button only links to pdf

removed button for the download and just let the toolbar for the pdf allow to download

moved picture of me from projects to home (somehow I put it there)

now adding a slideshow to the bottom home page and a link for the projects,

adding a slideshow to the home menu to give it some decoration, add more projects into projects only showcase 
3 or 4 stuff in the slideshow
centered the slideshow,
added text about the site and adding botton div add to others

added a copyright at the bottom of the website, and added a gallery in the projects section
shows a description of it and you can click on it for a bigger view

remember to change the background of the website
going to be adding canvas animation onto the projects, so it is not a gif, it is a 
animating image from javscript onto the canvas.
write a description of about myself in the about.
